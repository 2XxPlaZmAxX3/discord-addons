# Don't try to use these files!

Don't paste in custom CSS or Stylus or save these files, you won't get automatic updates, and some themes import multiple files like [AmoledDarkTheme](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/blob/master/download-themes-here/AmoledDarkTheme.theme.css) and [AmoledDarkThemeOptimized](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/blob/master/download-themes-here/AmoledDarkThemeOptimized.theme.css) (these themes need to import 2 files to know what version of AmoledDarkTheme you are using).

**So, until you know what you are doing, please use the files stored in the [download-themes-here](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here) folder!**

# Here's what you can find in this "nifn" folder:

## All full CSS files

The themes you download in the [download-themes-here](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here) folder import these files and supports automatic updates. You can view my full code here and you can also suggest me an edit, if you want.

### How my themes are automatically updated?

They use `@import url(http://…)` to import a file stored online in a website generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (that's why I created my website - trying to import a `raw.githubusercontent.com` link doesn't work).

**When I update a file in this repository, it will be automatically updated in my website and your theme will be updated once you reload.**

- An example of **wrong** import link: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/reponame/branch/folder/subfolder/file.css` (trying to import this kind of files will have no effect)
- An example of **correct** import link: `https://username.github.io/reponame/folder/subfolder/file.css` (that can be another domain instead of `*.github.io`)

## Build numbers, initials, status and changelogs

There's a [build-numbers](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/tree/master/nifn/build-numbers) folder where you can find all informations about updates. All in [one file](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/blob/master/nifn/build-numbers/README.md) (this is another readme).

In changelogs, initials are used. For example: **"[ADT](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/blob/master/download-themes-here/AmoledDarkTheme.theme.css):123 - A color fix…"** means **"[AmoledDarkTheme](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/blob/master/download-themes-here/AmoledDarkTheme.theme.css) build 123: A color fix…"**.
