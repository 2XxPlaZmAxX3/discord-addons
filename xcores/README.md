# This is the `xcores` folder.

Unless you know what you're doing, don't paste code from this folder to your custom CSS or Stylus, also don't save these files, because you won't get automatic updates, and some themes import multiple files like [AMOLED Dark Theme](https://github.com/discord-addons/discord-addons/blob/master/download-themes-here/AmoledDarkTheme.theme.css) (this theme needs to import 2 files to know which version of ADT you are using).

**So, unless you know what you are doing, please use the files stored in the [download-themes-here](https://github.com/discord-addons/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here) folder!**

# Here's what you can find in this "xcores" folder:

## All full CSS files

The themes you download in the [download-themes-here](https://github.com/discord-addons/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here) folder import these files and supports automatic updates. You can view my full code here and you can also suggest me an edit, if you want.

### How my themes are automatically updated?

Themes use `@import url(http://â€¦)` to import a file stored online in a website generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

**So when a file is updated in this repository, it will be automatically updated in the website, and your theme will be updated once you reload.**

- An example of **wrong** import link: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user-or-organization-name/repo-name/branch/folder/subfolder/file.css`
- An example of **correct** import link: `https://user-or-organization-name.github.io/repo-name/folder/subfolder/file.css`
