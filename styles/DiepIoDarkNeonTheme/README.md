# How to apply this Diep.io theme

1. Press the `Home` button in your keyboard to open the in-game console
    - Depending on your keyboard, that key could be represented as an **arrow pointing to the top-left** or just with the `Home` text. It could also be found using `NUMPAD 7` (num lock disabled).
    - Do not do this with `F12`/`Ctrl+Shift+I`, this opens the DevTools console and that's not the right one!
2. Paste the code that you just found
3. Press Enter
4. Press Home again to close
5. Enjoy!

## Remember:

- This doesn't automatically load at refresh, you must paste the code again.
- Reload `F5`/`Ctrl+R` to get rid of the theme.
