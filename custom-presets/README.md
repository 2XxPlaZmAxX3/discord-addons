- Using NSFW, illegal, copyrighted or suspicious content anywhere in the preset is not allowed.
- Some values you set may be modified, without changing the current appearance.
- You can use any customizable theme from Discord Addons. All the other themes (like BasicBackground or ClearVision) not from Discord Addons won't be accepted.
- You can always request modifications or delete your preset from the repo by asking or resubmitting.
- If you don't attach any preview/thumbnail, one will be directly generated for you.
