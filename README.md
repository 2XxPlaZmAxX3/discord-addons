## âš  Got any of Discord Addons themes:
- **Anywhere, before `Oct 6, 2021`?**
- Or from the [BetterDiscord website](https://betterdiscord.app/themes), before `Oct 22, 2021`?

You may redownload your theme or [change the import link](https://8io.gitbook.io/discord-addons/outdated-themes/update-the-import-link), because all themes linking to the old repo no longer work since **Oct 25, 2021**. You may also see a notice in Discord.

*This part will be removed soon.*
