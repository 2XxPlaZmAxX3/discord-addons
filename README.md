Welcome to this repository! Download the themes in the [download-themes-here](https://github.com/discord-addons/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here) folder.

## âš  Got any of Discord Addons themes:
- **Anywhere, before `Oct 6, 2021`?**
- Or from the BetterDiscord website, before `Oct 22, 2021`?

You may redownload your theme or [change the import link](https://8io.gitbook.io/discord-addons/outdated-themes/update-the-import-link), because all themes linking to the old repo no longer work since **Oct 25, 2021**. You may also see a notice in Discord.
