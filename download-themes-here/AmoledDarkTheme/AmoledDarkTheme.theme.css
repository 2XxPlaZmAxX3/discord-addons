 * @version 1.0.7
 * @description Enable the AMOLED dark theme for Discord for beautiful background colors like as the Android version (on Android, click 10 times on Dark in the Appearance settings). This theme does not interact with the Light theme and doesn't force you to switch to the Dark theme.
