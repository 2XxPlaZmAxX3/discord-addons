# Download themes here

Choose the folder you want, and save the file ending with `.theme.css`. If you are using Powercord, save also the `powercord_manifest.json`.

You can see theme compatibilities in each theme folder. If you are using a client mod that is not listed in the README file, try yourself if it works or not, but remember that other client mods are not supported in priority.
