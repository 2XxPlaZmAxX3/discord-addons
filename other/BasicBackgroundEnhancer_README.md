# How to use [BasicBackgroundEnhancer](https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/blob/master/other/BasicBackgroundEnhancer.css)?

In your BasicBackground file, just after the previous `@import url(…);`, paste this:
```css
@import url(https://tomrdh.github.io/discord-addons/nifn/other/BasicBackgroundEnhancer.css);

:root { /* Enhancer variables */
	--borderRadius:					25px;						/* default: 25px				(border radius for some elements)												*/
	--borderWidth:					3px;						/* default: 3px					(border widith for some elements)												*/

	--fontwhite1:					255,255,255;				/* default: 255,255,255			(font white 1 used in some texts, use rgb)										*/
	--fontwhite2:					210,210,210;				/* default: 210,210,210			(font white 2 used in some texts, use rgb)										*/
	--fontwhite3:					170,170,170;				/* default: 170,170,170			(font white 3 used in some texts, use rgb)										*/
	--fontwhite4:					120,120,120;				/* default: 120,120,120			(font white 4 used in some texts, use rgb)										*/
}
```

**You can change the new variables to customize the enhancer!**

## ⚠ PLEASE NOTE BEFORE USING

This is **unofficial**!

- The original [BasicBackground](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground) is **not** made by me, but by DevilBro;
- But BBE¹ is made by me ([TomRdh](https://github.com/Tomrdh)).
- So, remember that BBE is just a theme enhancer for BB² to add more style and more customization.
- If DevilBro wants me to delete this enhancer, I'll delete it and keep this only for me. I respect his work, and thanks to him to make all of his themes and plugins.

### Initials
- 1 — BBE = BasicBackgroundEnhancer
- 2 — BB = BasicBackground
